File Delivery Validation System (FDVS) is an open source software designed to aid with large scale file deliveries.
The purpose of the software is to validate the content of a folder meant for delivery by checking if the files requested by an item list exists within the delivery folder structure.

**STEPS:**

- Step 1: Import the delivery item list from a single column long .csv, .xlsx, or .xml file.
- Step 2: Specify which folder structure that encapsulates the delivery.
- Step 3: Validate that the expected files requested by the item list exists within the folder structure.
- Step 4: Export a pdf or excel sheet containing the delivery specifications.
